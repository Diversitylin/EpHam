The procedure to run the example in the folder qgrid_6x6x1:

1. Perform lattice dynamics calculations by executing following scripts step by step: setup_harmonic_no_minkowski.sh, convert_quadratic_lin.sh, w003_run_harmonic_openmx.sh, cleanup_openmx.sh, lte_harmonic.sh.
2. Perform quadratic calculations by executing following scripts step by step: setup_quadratic.sh, convert_quadratic_lin.sh, w003_run_openmx_quadratic.sh, scfout_quadratic.sh
3. Go to folder 1.Kup_Kup (2.-KdownKup，3.Kup-Kdown，4.-Kdown-Kdown) to construct a Hamiltonian by executing the Hop package.
